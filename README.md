# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me

My name is Artur, I'm Polish privacy activist, [cypherpunk](https://monogr.ph/65ee3e6ef3f3f3060ce9e9ef/) and backup freak ;)

I've spent over **6 years** in infosec trying to teach people basics of cybersecurity. My efforts included creating courses about cybersecurity and founding a Facebook group about cybersecurity and privacy (in ~2018, now with over 8000 members, in the Polish reality, this was a very good result).

## My current projects

Apart from my side projects (like creating browser extension to improve the privacy of twitter users) and legislative activity, translations for privacy-friendly tools I've also started few main projects:

[Privacy Links](https://github.com/Arturro43/privacy-links) - list of privacy friendly alternatives to Big Tech services
[idontuse.it](https://idontuse.it/) - community-driven homepage for all privacy-minded people. If someone asks you to contact via Whatsapp, just simply reply idontuse.it instead of explaining why :)
And my [blog](https://arturro43.github.io/blog/) which is kinda... dead...
